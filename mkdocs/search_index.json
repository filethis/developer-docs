            "text": "FileThisConnect Demo\n\n\nThe \nFileThisConnect Demo\n is a single-page application served from \nfilethis.com\n that embeds an instance of the FileThisConnect web component element. It is a fixture that wraps a UI around the component, letting you configure, control, and play with the instance. All you need to make it work are your FileThis partner account API key and API secret strings. You can obtain copies of these strings by copying them out of your FileThis partner admin console. If you have not yet gotten set up with your own partner account, please contact us.\n\n\nThe purpose of the demo app is to let you get familiar with how the available variants of the web component appear and behave, and how they guide users through complete document fetching workflows, without yet looking \"under the hood\" to see how the web component element is wired up.\n\n\nOnce you've completed this section you'll be ready to move on to the next, in which you'll learn how to embed the FileThisConnect web component into a very simple website that you serve from your development machine.\n\n\nLoading the App\n\n\nStart by loading the the demo app into your browser from \nhere\n.\n\n\nNote that the values you enter into most of the fields in this app will be stored in the browser local storage for your convenience. When you visit the page again, or refresh it, the fields will retain the values you entered previously. Fields which contain secrets are not stored with encryption. If you're not comfortable with leaving them there between sessions, you may click the \"Clear\" button at the bottom right of the configuration panel when you're done working.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\n\n\nIf the configuration side-panel on the left of the window is not open, click the right-pointing arrow button at the upper left of the window to open it.\n\n\nCopy and paste both your API key and API secret strings into the labeled fields.\n\n\nVerify that they are valid by clicking the \"Test\" button to the right of the fields.\n\n\nCreate a FileThis user account for testing by clicking the \"New\" button to the right of the account ID field.\n\n\nObserve that an account ID number appears in the field.\n\n\nTest the validity of the account ID by clicking the \"Test\" button to the right of the field. You can do this at any point in the future as a sanity check.\n\n\nCreate a user access token for the account by clicking the \"New\" button to the right of the \"Token\" field.\n\n\nObserve that a token string appears in the field.\n\n\nTest the validity of the token by clicking the \"Test\" button to the right of the field. This is useful for testing whether your token has expired, or not before using it for additional testing.\n\n\nObserve that there are two \"variants\" of the FileThisConnect web component available under the popup menu in the middle of the header bar of the main panel. These are: \nft-connect-expand-out\n and \nft-connect-tabbed\n. The former lets the user see a number of panels on the screen at the same time, expanding out to the right side of the web component element for each panel. The latter makes better use of screen real estate, placing each panel into a tab bar. You can chose the variant to use now, and you can change it later, once the web component is running. Other variants will be available shortly.\n\n\n\n\nBringing the Web Component to Life\n\n\nHaving created a user account and user token, these will be injected into the instance of the FileThisConnect web component element for you. The main panel of the demo app is where the component is embedded. To turn it on, click the \"power\" button at the top right of the window. You should see the component appear, showing a list of company logos for websites from which we can fetch documents. The component is now \"alive\" and communicating with the FileThis production server.\n\n\nIf an error occurs during the use of the web component instance, an error dialog will be displayed by the demo app, and the component will be turned off, as indicated by the power button at the top right. The expiration of the user token is one such error case. When you embed the component into your product's website, you will likely wire up your own handler for error events to deal with things in your own way.\n\n\nDepending on which variant of the web component you selected, you will see one or more of the \"panel\" sub-components at different points in the user workflows. We describe each of these, next.\n\n\nThe \"Sites\" Panel\n\n\nThe first step in any FileThis user workflow is to allow the user to find and select a company website from which they can fetch their documents. The FileThisConnect web component variants all begin by presenting the user with a list of all companies to which we can connect. We have a sub-component named \nft-source-panel\n which provides this functionality.\n\n\nThe web component instance in your demo app begins by displaying this panel. Note that users can narrow down which companies are displayed by selecting a filter preset from a popup menu, and/or by entering a search string which matches company names. When the user recognizes a company to which they want to connect, they click its logo. When they do so, the component poses a modal dialog that prompts them to enter their username and password for the site's account. When they commit the dialog, the component tells the FileThis server to create the connection and kick off the document-fetching operation.\n\n\nYou're welcome to test fetching documents from any website for which you have valid credentials, but for the sake of convenience you might begin by connecting to our test website. Depending on the fake password string you enter when you connect to the test site, you can explore a variety of different user workflows in a deterministic manner. You can find the test site in the company list by typing \"test\" into the search field. For example, you can choose a \"happy path\" that always returns a list of fake billing statements, never interrupting the workflow with a challenge question. The credentials that specify this workflow are:\n\n\nUsername: user\nPassword: bills\n\n\n\n\nOr, you can cause the site to challenge you with any of several kinds of questions. \nThis page\n documents the variety of use cases that the test site can simulate.\n\n\nThe \"Connections\" Panel\n\n\nHaving created a connection, either to our test site, or a real-world company site, you will see a representation of the connection appear in a list in the next panel \u2014an instance of our \nft-connection-panel\n subcomponent.\n\n\nAs soon as a connection is created, our server kicks off the first document fetching job for it. This takes about as long to complete as it would take a speedy user to log in directly to the company site in their web browser, navigate to the download page, click the appropriate button to start the download, wait for available documents in a certain date range to finish downloading, and then log out. Because this process isn't instantaneous, the web component provides feedback to users to give them a sense of progress and to show them that they're being saved from having to do some rather tedious manual work.\n\n\nNote that an indeterminate progress indicator spins within the connection item that you created, indicating that work is being done. As soon as each document is downloaded by our service, you will see a thumbnail of the document's first page appear in the web component. After the last document appears, the progress indicator in the connection item stops spinning, and it returns to a resting state, showing the date of the last successful fetch operation.\n\n\nIt's not uncommon for websites to pose challenge questions after users log in successfully with their username and password. These can be questions like \"What is your mother's maiden name?\", or multiple-choice questions, or a prompt for a PIN code. When our fetching service encounters such a question on a website, it must be conveyed to the user on your website by some means, so that it can be answered by them. The answer they provide must then be sent back to our fetching service so that the operation can resume. The FileThisConnect web component handles this back-and-forth for you, dynamically rendering a modal dialog on your website to pose the question to the user, collecting their answer, and returning it to our service.\n\n\nOur test site provides a convenient and deterministic way to test a variety of workflows that include challenge questions of different types. Again, \nthis document\n tells you which fake password string to use to determine the workflow to simulate.\n\n\nIf you're curious about the internal representation of challenge questions used by FileThis, take a look at \nthis application\n. The left-side column shows the JSON data that represents the question. The center column is a live instance of our \nft-user-interaction-form\n sub-component which dynamically renders the question data as a modal dialog. The right-side column displays the JSON data that represents the answer that the user enters into the dialog.\n\n\nThe \"Documents\" Panel\n\n\nWe mentioned above that as documents start to be fetched from a company website for the connections created by a user, we display thumbnails of their first page in our web component. This uses an instance of our \nft-document-panel\n sub-component. The display of this panel is optional, but it gives the user a rewarding sense that real work is being done on their behalf.\n\n\nThe Next Step\n\n\nNow that you've been able to play with an instance of the FileThisConnect web component in an application served by our servers, you are ready to take another step on your way to fully embedding the component into your own website. In the next section, you'll go a bit further, instantiating the component in a minimal website that is served from your development box.",

Unlike the \nFileThisConnect Demo\n application that you used in the \nprevious section\n, this website will be served from your own development machine, not from \nfilethis.com\n. Because you'll have the site's source files, you'll be able to see just how simple the embedding is. Also, when you've finished, you'll have installed a number of development tools that you'll need in the final section. \n\n\nTrue to its name, this website is \"minimal\" in that there is no support in it for creating a FileThis user account or user access token, as there was in the \nFileThisConnect Demo\n fixture's UI. You'll simply paste pre-created user account id and access token strings into the component's element attributes in the main HTML file. In the next section, where you embed the component into your actual website, your code will obtain these values by calling our API and then injecting them into the component programmatically.\n\n\nAll of the FileThis web components, sub-components, demo and sample applications are available as open source in public GitHub repositories. The code for this website, named \nft-connect-minimal-site\n lives \nhere\n. The instructions below will ask you to download a copy of it to your machine.\n\n\nDevelopment Environment Setup\n\n\nThere are a number of tools you'll need to install to support bootstrapping the \nft-connect-minimal-site\n project and running it on your dev machine.\n\n\nThe following instructions assume you have a Unix-like shell environment, but should work without too much trouble on a Windows box, as well. Feedback about how to improve the instructions for the Windows platform is welcome.\n\n\nInstall the Node Package Manager\n\n\nThe Node Package Manager (NPM) makes it easy to download and install Javascript tools and libraries from the command line. We need it for just one reason: to install a tool called Bower, which is yet another package manager. Bower is used by Polymer (though there is talk about moving to NPM, instead).\n\n\nThe easiest way to install the \nnpm\n command line tool is to install the whole NodeJS package. You can get the installer from \nhere\n.\n\n\nOnce it's installed, verify that the \nnpm\n command is available in your terminal by running:\n\n\nnpm --version\n\n\n\nand observing that you are given a version number.\n\n\nInstall Git\n\n\nBower uses Git to store the code and version tags associated with the packages that it manages. The \ngit\n command line tool must be installed on your machine in order for it to work.\n\n\nThere are many ways to install Git on each platform. Follow \nthis guide\n to decide the best way for you. \n\n\nWhen you're done, verify that the \ngit\n command is available in your terminal by running:\n\n\ngit --version\n\n\n\nInstall Bower\n\n\nNext, we use NPM to install Bower. Run this command:\n\n\nnpm install -g bower\n\n\n\nYou should see some verbose progress information fly by as other packages that Bower depends on are installed, ending with some indication of success.\n\n\nVerify that you have the \nbower\n command available in your terminal by running:\n\n\nbower --version\n\n\n\nChoose a webserver\n\n\nIn order to run the \nft-connect-minimal-site\n app, you'll need to serve its project files so that your browser can render them. If you already have a favorite local webserver of some kind, you can skip this step. If you don't, here are some options:\n\n\nBrowserSync\n\n\nBrowserSync\n is a personal favorite at FileThis and is highly recommended. Among several nifty features is one that automatically reloads the page when any served file changes \u2014Make a change in your editor, save it, see the page rerender with the change.\n\n\nInstall with:\n\n\nnpm install -g browser-sync\n\n\n\nand run with:\n\n\nbrowser-sync start --config \"bs-config.js\" --server --port 3505\n\n\n\nNote that if you want to the use the configuration options in the \nbs-config.js\n file, you will need to run this from inside your \nft-connect-minimal-site\n project directory. If you don't use this file, you'll need to either define your own, or add configuration options to the command line.\n\n\nYou can take advantage of BrowserSync's automatic loading feature even if you choose to use your own webserver, or one of the options listed below by using its \"proxy\" feature.\n\n\nbrowser-sync start --proxy localhost:8888 --config \"bs-config.js\" --server --port 3505\n\n\n\nwhere \"localhost:8888\" is the URL of your webserver\n\n\nPython 2.7+\n\n\nAssuming you already have Python 2.7 installed, run with:\n\n\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 3505\n\n\n\nPython 3.x\n\n\nAssuming you already have Python 3 installed, run with:\n\n\npython -m http.server 3505\n\n\n\nRuby 1.9.2+\n\n\nAssuming you already have Ruby installed, run with:\n\n\nruby -run -ehttpd . -p3505\n\n\n\nnode-static\n\n\nInstall with:\n\n\nnpm install -g node-static\n\n\n\nand run with:\n\n\nruby -run -ehttpd . -p3505\n\n\n\nPHP 5.4+\n\n\nAssuming you already have PHP installed, run with:\n\n\nphp -S 127.0.0.1:3505\n\n\n\nRuntime Environment Setup\n\n\nNow you're ready to download the \nft-connect-minimal-site\n code to your development machine and install the libraries that it needs to run.\n\n\nGet the project source code\n\n\nFind a place for the project code to live on your filesystem and clone the remote repository using:\n\n\ngit clone git@github.com:filethis/ft-connect-minimal-site.git\n\n\n\nThen move into the created project directory:\n\n\ncd ft-connect-minimal-site\n\n\n\nInstall the dependent libraries\n\n\nNow we can use Bower to download and install all the other polymer elements that the app uses, as well as the small Polymer runtime support library.\n\n\nIf you're curious, take a look at the list of dependencies in the \nbower.json\n file in the project directory. The \nbower\n command will read each of these in turn and pull down not only these dependencies, but any dependencies of the listed packages, recursively.\n\n\nWhile still inside your \nft-connect-minimal-site\n directory, install the dependencies by running:\n\n\nbower install\n\n\n\nYou will see a lot of progress information go by. It should complete without error or interruption.\n\n\nWhen done, take a look in your project directory and observe that there is a new directory called \nbower_components\n. This should be full of a number of Polymer components that the project depends on.\n\n\nFor future reference, you will need to deploy a copy of the \nbower_components\n directory to your production server so that your chosen FileThisConnect component can load the elements that it needs.\n\n\nRuntime configuration\n\n\nAs mentioned above, this project does not provide any runtime support for either creating a FileThis user account, or for obtaining a user access token. You will need to paste literal values for both of these into the source code before running it.\n\n\nGet an account ID and user access token\n\n\nUse the \nFileThisConnect Demo\n application now and copy a valid FileThis account id and a user access token from it. You may want to create a fresh token so that it does not expire anytime soon.\n\n\nConfigure the account ID and user access token\n\n\nIn an editor, open the \n./src/ft-connect-minimal-site.html\n file in your project directory. Locate the \nuser-account-id\n attribute of the element and paste the account id string into its value. Locate the \ntoken\n attribute and paste the token string into its value. Save your changes.\n\n\nAbout CORS\n\n\nIt may already have occurred to you to there is a potential problem here: Browsers prevent access to data from more than one domain in order to prevent cross-site script exploits. Our component is about to be loaded from your local file system (domain \nlocalhost\n), and it intends to make \nXMLHttpRequest\n (\"AJAX\") calls to the FileThis service, (domain \nfilethis.com\n). Unless we do something special, your browser will happily load the component, and then simply refuse to make the HTTP requests to FileThis.\n\n\nFortunately, browser manufacturers have provided a way to make specific exceptions to the cross-domain restriction in a safe manner. They call this Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS, for short.

The FileThisConnect component that you embed into your website will be served, along with all your other files, from your own domains. The FileThis server will need to have a CORS whitelist entry for your address \u2014something like \nhttps://acme.com\n and \nhttps://staging.acme.com\n.

You'll simply paste pre-created user account id and access token strings into the component's element attributes in the main HTML file. In the next section, where you embed the component into your actual website, your code will obtain these values by calling our API and then injecting them into the component programmatically.

Our component is about to be loaded from your local file system (domain  localhost ), and it intends to make  XMLHttpRequest  (\"AJAX\") calls to the FileThis service, (domain  filethis.com ). Unless we do something special, your browser will happily load the component, and then simply refuse to make the HTTP requests to FileThis.  Fortunately, browser manufacturers have provided a way to make specific exceptions to the cross-domain restriction in a safe manner. They call this Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, or CORS, for short. In brief, it works like this:   When the browser is asked to send an HTTP request to an origin other than the one from which the site was originally loaded, it first builds a \"preflight\" request that has the same URL and contains all the same headers as the actual request.  The browser sends its preflight request to the server using the  OPTIONS  HTTP verb.  Upon receiving this  OPTIONS  request, the server reads the domain name and port from the request's  ORIGIN  header ( http://localhost:3505 , in our case) and looks this up in an internal whitelist table of some kind. If it finds a match, it responds with success to the  OPTIONS  request, returning a 200 result code. If it does not find a match, it returns with a non-200 response. We mention in passing that there are other request and response headers which further refine what the requestor is asking to do and, in turn, what server will allow.  When it receives a 200 response to its  OPTIONS  preflight request, the browser then sends the original request, and things proceed normally.
