Documentation pages are written in Markdown. The site structure is defined by [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) using a [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/filethis/developer-docs/blob/master/mkdocs.yml) file.

The Makefile in this project provides targets that are similar to the convention we use in our Polymer projects. To see documentation of the targets, use:

    make
