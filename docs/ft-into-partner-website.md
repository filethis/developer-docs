# Embedding into Your Website

This section is under construction. What it will do, in short, is guide you through:

1. Embedding the FileThisConnect web component into your website in the appropriate place within your workflow.
2. Adding code to your system to make a call to the FileThis API to create a FileThis user account that corresponds, one-to-one, with the user account in your system.
3. Add code to your system to obtain a user access token for the user account and to inject this into the FileThis web component.
4. Show you how to customize and style the FileThis web component using element attributes, CSS, and JavaScript calls.
5. Exposing a webhook endpoint in your system to which the FileThis server will deliver documents fetched on behalf of your users.

Until this section has been released, please engage with us on our shared Slack channel for realtime guidance.
