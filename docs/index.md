# Welcome!

These pages will walk you through embedding the FileThis web components into your website. With very little coding on your part, you can present your users with a UI that provides a simple workflow for collecting documents from their online accounts, and then delivering them to your service on your users' behalf. 

We've divided this guide into a number steps. You can work your way through each step by clicking on the items in the table of contents to the left, or by just clicking the "Next" button when you come to the end of each section.
